        <p id="para1">Hi! I live here in beautiful Colorado. 
            I love to spend time with my family, work out and have fun. 
            I also love to travel.  I have been fortunate to see Hawaii, 
            and many other states, as well as Germany, 
            Mexico and the Virgin Islands. There are still many places that 
            I would love to visit and see.
